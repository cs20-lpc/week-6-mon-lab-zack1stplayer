# Week-6-Mon-Lab
Week 6 Mon Lab

This lab consists of two parts.

### Part A ###

## Directions

For the first part of the lab activity, you are going to implement a recursive solution to finding a maximum through the tail method discussed in lecture. The `main` function has already been written for you to run test cases. The output from your function needs to match with the fixed output.

The `findMaxRecTail` function has 3 parameters:

1. `arr` - a constant array containing the elements
2. `SIZE` - a constant integer that holds the number of elements in `arr`
3. `i` - an integer that represents the current position of the "head" of `arr`, with a default value of 0

To continue practicing how to analyze code, you are suggested to perform a time complexity analysis. You can do so as a comment block above the function.

# Part B

## Directions

For the second part of the lab activity, you are going to implement a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. The `main` function has already been written for you to run the first 5 cases.

Your implementation should display a message when it "moves" a disk from the source rod to the target rod. Use the format below, replacing `i`, `x`, and `y` with actual values:
```text
Moving disc i from rod #x to rod #y
```

The `towerHanoi` procedure has 5 parameters:

1. `numDisks` - an integer that represents the number of disks
2. `source` - a string that names the source rod
3. `buffer` - a string that names the buffer rod
4. `target` - a string that names the target rod
5. `numMoves` - a reference to an integer that holds the number of moves made so far

To continue practicing how to analyze code, you are suggested to perform a time complexity analysis. You can do so as a comment block above the function.

## Sample Run

If you implemented the function correctly, you should get the following output from the program:

```text

Trying n = 1

Moving disc 1 from Rod #1 to Rod #3

Number of Moves = 1
----------------------------------------
